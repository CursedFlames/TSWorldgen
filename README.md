Installation of modules:  
`npm install` ...and wait for the densest object in the known universe (`node_modules`) to be downloaded to your computer

Compilation:  
`npx ttsc`  
`npx webpack`

or, to run npx locally when it doesn't feel like working properly:  
`node node_modules\npx\index.js ttsc`  
`node node_modules\npx\index.js webpack`  

then open whatever html page has the thing you want :shrug:
